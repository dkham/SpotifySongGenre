**Objective**
The data science team is tasked with automatically recognizing a song’s genre when a song is added to its database, rather than manually classifying a song genre. This will help improve song library customization by learning what song genres are listened to most. The data science team will build machine learning models that will learn to distinguish songs based on key audio features. The team will then determine the best model for predicting and recognizing song genres.

**Method:**
Developed machine learning models for song genre classification using time series data to optimize song library personalization by accurately predicting and classifying genres based on user preferences. Employed various algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network, and Logistic Regression. 

**Lessons:**
- Random Forest performed the best once dataset was normalized and standardized.
- Feature scaling and balancing data is crucial for some models.
- The benefits of different feature engineering techniques will vary from model to model.
- Establishing a baseline gave us better appreciation for our model, even though the accuracy wasn’t objectively high.
- More investigation into balancing techniques could be helpful.
